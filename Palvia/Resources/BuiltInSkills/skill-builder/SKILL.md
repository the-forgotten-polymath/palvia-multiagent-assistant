# Skill Builder

Use this skill when the user asks you to create, modify, or fork an Palvia
skill. Palvia skills are directories under `/skills/<slug>/` that you author
through the `fs.*` bridge — there are no `create_skill`/`edit_skill` LLM tools.
The canonical structure is documented in `references/example-tooled.md`.

## Authoring flow (the happy path)

1. **Pick a slug.** Lowercase, hyphenated, unique. Check existing slugs with
   `fs.list('skills')` and `list_skills`. Slugs are stable identifiers —
   renaming a slug breaks any agent that has the skill installed.
2. **Scaffold the package.** Call
   `skill_skill_builder_scaffold(slug, name, description, tags?)` —
   writes a minimal valid `SKILL.md` plus empty `tools/` and `scripts/`
   directories in one shot.
3. **Add tools.** For each function-call tool, call
   `skill_skill_builder_add_tool(slug, tool_name, description, parameters?)`.
   It writes `tools/<tool_name>.js` with the META declaration prefilled and
   a `TODO` body. Replace the body with `fs.writeFile`.
4. **Add scripts** (optional). For each `run_snippet`-callable helper, call
   `skill_skill_builder_add_script(slug, script_name, description)`. Same
   pattern: writes a skeleton you replace via `fs.writeFile`.
5. **Validate.** `validate_skill(slug=...)` runs the same Swift-side
   parser the auto-reload path uses. Fix every error before installing;
   warnings are advisory.
6. **Install.** `install_skill(name=<frontmatter name>)`. Palvia materializes
   a `Skill` row from the on-disk package and binds it to the current
   agent. Custom tools immediately become available as `skill_<slug>_<tool>`.

## Editing an existing skill

1. **Read first** — `fs.readFile('skills/<slug>/SKILL.md')` to avoid
   destructively rewriting unrelated content.
2. **Write** — `fs.writeFile('skills/<slug>/...')`. Auto-reload runs against
   the modified package on success; if the rewrite breaks parsing, the last
   good version of the skill keeps running until you fix the package.
3. **Re-validate** — `validate_skill(slug=...)` after every batch of edits.
4. **No re-install needed** — the cached Skill row updates automatically.
   Only slug renames require uninstall + reinstall.

## Forking a built-in

Built-in skills (under slugs in `BuiltInSkills.shippedSlugs`) are read-only.
Fork before editing:

    fs.cp('skills/deep-research', 'skills/my-research', { recursive: true });

The copy lives in `<Documents>/Skills/` and is fully writable. Edit, validate,
and `install_skill` as usual.

## Permission notes

Writes under `/skills/<slug>/` require the `fs_skill_write` per-agent
permission in addition to whatever permission the action itself needs (e.g.
`files.writeFile`). Agents without `fs_skill_write` can still read packages
and use installed skills — they just can't author or modify them.
